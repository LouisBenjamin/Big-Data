# Big-Data

## Abstract

For this SOEN471 project, we will be analyzing in a team of two people, the scripts of the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. Using dataset analysis learned in previous courses (Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics), we will discuss and interpret various areas of the movies, namely the frequency of the words used in dialogue. Using tools like scikit learn and Jupyter notebook, we will write, and in-depth analysis related to the following topics with their corresponding graphical representation: importance of the characters, bigram frequencies, sentiment analysis, and (optionally) compare dialogues between what is represented as “good” and “bad”.
As a disclaimer, we were inspired by the following project: https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/analyzing-star-wars-movie-scripts/report
